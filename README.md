# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Random Forest.

## Dataset
Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset (highly imbalanced).

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and analyzed dataset imbalance
- Performed stratified train-test split
- Trained Logistic Regression as baseline
- Trained Random Forest for better performance
- Evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualized feature importance
- Saved best model using joblib

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (final model)

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy was avoided due to imbalance.
Used:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Result
Random Forest significantly improved fraud detection performance.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
